# Snake-Game
Snake Game is a classic arcade-style browser game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a focus on simplicity, interactivity, and clean design. The game features three difficulty levels — Easy, Moderate, and Hard — allowing players to challenge themselves based on their skill level. Each mode adjusts the snake's speed, offering a progressively harder experience.

To enhance the gameplay experience, the project includes sound effects for food consumption, game over events, and looping background music. The game is fully responsive, making it accessible on both desktop and mobile devices. This project was developed as part of my learning journey in web development, helping me strengthen my understanding of DOM manipulation, event handling, game logic, and multimedia integration using pure JavaScript.

Overall, this project reflects my goal to create a fun and functional game while practicing core front-end development concepts without using any frameworks or external libraries.
